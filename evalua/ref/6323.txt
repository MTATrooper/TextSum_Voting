fbi director james comey suggested in remarks last week that poles were accomplices during the holocaust . comey's comments are offensive to poles as they had no role in running death camps and were themselves victims of the third reich . poles see themselves as heroes of the war who have never been properly recognized , making the comments yet more hurtful .
