biologists at durham university spent four months recording gibbon calls . they recorded gibbons making 450 hoo calls from 25 animals that were impossible to distinguish with the human ear and were often inaudible . each call was found to relate to different contexts like foraging , meeting neighbours , singing to mates or warning others about a predator nearby .
