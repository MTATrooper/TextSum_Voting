willa junior took a nap in the cargo hold of a plane at seattle tacoma airport on april 13 , and woke up after the flight to los angeles took off . the baggage handler , who appears to be in his 20 s according to facebook , tried calling his company and 911 but his phone eventually failed . he says he was afraid he might die , so he texted his mother a message , telling her i love you in a last ditch effort , junior started banging on the ceiling of the cargo hold and his yells were so loud that passengers and crew heard .
