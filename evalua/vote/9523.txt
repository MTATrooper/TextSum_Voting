after years of suffering behind its barbed wire fences , watching those they loved waste away before their eyes while nazi guards systematically slaughtered them by the tens of thousands this is the moment the inmates of bergen belsen watched as the death camp was burned to the ground . steeped in human misery , these huts once contained the bodies of thousands of jews , gypsies , homosexuals , nazi opponents and the disabled , sent to an inhuman death by adolf hitler and his demented regime . diarist anne frank , and her sister margot , also died here . these hellish images , which were taken by british reverend charles martin king parsons , captured that poignant moment in history for future generations to remember . shortly after the camp was liberated by british and canadian troops in 1945 , it was torched , and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings , along with the reichskriegs flag and hitler portrait which adorned them , were consumed by flames . in 1942 they were forced into hiding in secret rooms hidden inside otto frank's office building .
