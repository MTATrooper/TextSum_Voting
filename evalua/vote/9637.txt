now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide . the reservoirs are secure , and scientists do n t believe they will impact climate change . instead , they say similar formations could someday be used to store methane , that can later be used as fuel . but there is another form of the deadly gas , dubbed abiotic methane , that is created by forms chemical through reactions a in process the called crust serpentinisation beneath . the seafloor reservoirs . are methane secure , the principle component in and natural scientists gas do , n is t usually believe produced they by will organic impact material climate decomposing change .
