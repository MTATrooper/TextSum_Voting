surfer shannon aston , from new zealand , said he felt compelled to start photographing the area while he was living and working in south korea as a teacher . so it comes as a surprise that the korean demilitarized zone dmz located along the no man's land between the north and south is next to a burgeoning surf spot for south korean hipsters , gangsters , ex pats and its jet setting adventure class . photos captured at the site show an eclectic mix of people going about their day to day duties , where fishermen and day trippers are placed alongside soldiers , tanks and their fortified military installations . the dmz was established in 1953 as a buffer zone to separate the north from the south . the north from the south .
