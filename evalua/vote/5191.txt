gibbons better known for their deafening songs that reverberate around the forests they inhabit have been found to regularly use the secretive form of communication . the apes , which are found in the forest of south east asia , produce a variety of soft call types , known as hoos , that are almost inaudible to the human ear . the researchers found that predator hoos in particular were produced at frequencies well below the threshold of hearing for eagles and other birds of prey . lars gibbons like this one in khao yai national park thailand use soft hoo calls that are similar to whispers . a dictionary that decodes the calls produced by gibbons is being developed by scientists .
