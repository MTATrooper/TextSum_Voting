our fascination with aeroplanes , and the men who fly them it is still overwhelmingly men , has acquired a morbid flavour since germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the french alps by its troubled co pilot andreas lubitz . when he was writing it he had never heard of lubitz , of course , but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated . mark vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with british airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job . the tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots , and airline vetting procedures , in which just about all of us have a vested interest . this makes mark vanhoenacker's book , unwittingly , very timely indeed . by mark vanhoenacker .
