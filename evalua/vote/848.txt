cnn it's the simplest possible assignment , but it always teaches a huge lesson . every year , denver teacher kyle schwartz passes out post it notes to her third grade students and asks them to complete the sentence , i wish my teacher knew ... many of the students she teaches at doull elementary just wish they had something in common with her , that she knew soccer or video games . and other who has big hopes for the future i want to go to college . one student just wants more attention from the teacher .
