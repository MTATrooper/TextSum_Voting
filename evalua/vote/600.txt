cnn bernie sanders , my vermont senator and , indeed , a friend of many years , is now running for president . to most americans , of course , sen . bernie sanders is only a name , if that . he is barely known to the general public , which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation . and he nobody was socialist should never , underestimate a of him democrat course . and is n t yet . he's a progressive , holding his seat in the u . s . senate as an independent , although he votes with the democrats on major issues .
