the experts were able to take control of a so called telerobot during surgery by exploiting a simple programming trick . researchers at the university of washington studied the telerobot raven ii shown . they found that robots designed for surgery could be easily hacked in to . this is because they are operated over public networks which allowed the researchers to access them and stop them working . while a this flaw experiment in was robots performed designed in to a perform controlled surgery environment has and been not found on that the lets operating them table be stock easily image hacked pictured , according to the researchers . this said enabled it them is to clear change more the stringent speed security of measures the are arms needed of . the robot experts and were change able their to orientation take , control making of it a impossible so for called the telerobot machines during to surgery carry by out exploiting a procedure simple as programming directed trick .
