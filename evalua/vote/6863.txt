the gases desflurane , isoflurane and sevoflurane are potent greenhouse gases that have 2,500 times the impact on global warming compared to carbon dioxide . scientists say they have detected the gases used in anaesthetic as far a field as antarctica and concentrations have been rising globally in the past decade . the gases desflurane , isoflurane and sevoflurane are atmospheric potent scientists anaesthetic greenhouse who gases that have used 2,500 times the impact on global warming compared to carbon dioxide . anaesthetic is used been to monitoring send the patients gases to say sleep that during while surgery the are concentrations accumulating in the earth's above atmosphere are but low it , where they are having may an also increasing be effect warming on contributing the to climate change planet .
