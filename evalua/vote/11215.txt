scientists took ct scans of teeth found at riparo bombrini in western ligurian alps left and in the grotta di fumane in western lessini mountains right , both in italy , and found they belonged to ancestors of modern humans who were part of a group known as the protoaurignacian culture . neanderthals were the dominant human species in europe and much of asia for around 250,000 years before vanishing entirely 41,000 years ago . now scientists have found proof that a group of modern humans known as the protoaurignacian culture arrived in southern europe at around the same time the neanderthals disappeared . they have been able to conclusively show that a pair of ancient baby teeth found at two prehistoric sites in northern italy belong to modern humans from this culture .
