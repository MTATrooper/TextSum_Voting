just look at what happened to sue perkins this week , who received a barrage of abuse on twitter when her name was mentioned for the role , along the lines of men do cars , women do cake . sarah vine says the bbc need to look further than just men when it comes to finding a tv presenter to replace jeremy clarkson on top gear . why because women love cars just as much men top gear is definitely not just for male petrolheads 40 per cent of the show's audience is female . but jeremy clarkson pictured did not have his contract renewed with the bbc show after an incident with a member of the production staff . but i think i m perfect for fiat the is job mine , and my principal qualification is entirely mine basic alone . i love cars .
