the solar probe plus will carry four experiments into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star . during solar the probe closest plus passes will around carry the four sun instrument , suites temperatures into outside the spacecraft will reach nearly 2,500 corona degrees and fahrenheit study . the solar closest wind three and will energetic be particles just as 3.8 they million blast miles off from the surface of the star . during over the 24 closest orbits passes , around the mission will use sun seven , flybys temperatures of outside venus the to spacecraft reduce will its reach distance nearly from 2,500 the degrees sun fahrenheit .
