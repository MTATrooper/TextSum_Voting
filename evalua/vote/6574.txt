durham university scientists studied a clump of dark matter that appears to be lagging behind its galaxy suggesting it interacts with itself . in this hubble image , the lagging clump can be seen on the left of the central cluster . the distribution of dark matter in the cluster is shown with blue contour lines . this is despite seeming to account for 85 but per the cent discovery of a the clump universe's lagging mass behind and a having galaxy an suggests observable that effect it on may galaxies not without be dark as matter oblivious , to our galaxies would fall apart universe as they we spin thought . now an international team of researchers at durham university has so found the a 85 clump per offset cent from figure a above galaxy relates by only 5,000 to light the years fraction , of suggesting matter that is not the case dark .
